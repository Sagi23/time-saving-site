### Description

My first attempt at creating a service selling site.  
My first time using gsap library.  
The site is responsive to all devices.

### The Stack i used:

html, scss/css, js, adobe xd.

### Workflow:

Made a mockup using adobe xd.  
Created the mockup using html and scss.  
I had some difficulties with making the site fully responsive but with the help of css grid and the beauty of scss i got the job done.  
Had some fun playing around with the gsap library.  
Integrated the js to the html file.

### What i learned:

Improved scss skills.  
Improved css grid skills.  
Improved html slills.  
How important the idea of mobile first thinking.  
Improved docs reading.  
Improved library integration.
